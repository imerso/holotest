HOW IT WAS DONE:

- Created Unreal 4.27 C++ blank project;
- Went to hologate.com and saved a color logo;
- Opened the logo in GIMP, made it b&w then saved again;
- Imported into Inkscape, vectorized then exported to svg;
- Imported the svg into Blender, extruded and exported hologate.obj;
- Deleted part of the mesh, added armature and exported to player.fbx;
- Imported both into the project;
- Started creating the little game with mostly C++.


HOW TO PLAY:

Run the game and select HOST or JOIN. If you click HOST, other players in the same network will fill your machine IP address and click JOIN to enter your server host.
Look around with mouse, fire with left-click and move with WASD keys.
Energy and score are tracked for each player. When a player is dead, that player can respawn pressing [ENTER]. When respawning, score is kept for the session and energy is reset to full.
